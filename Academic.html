    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application uses a sidebar navigation for the 8 subject categories and a main content area. This structure was chosen to make a large, dense report easily navigable without extensive scrolling. Users can quickly switch between subjects. The main area features a dynamic donut chart for a quick visual summary of assessment weights, paired with a detailed table for in-depth information. This dual-view approach caters to different user needs—from quick overviews to detailed analysis—and turns a static document into an interactive, user-friendly tool. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Assessment percentage breakdown per category. -> Goal: Inform & Compare. -> Viz/Presentation Method: A dynamic donut chart (for high-level visual comparison) and a detailed HTML table (for specifics). -> Interaction: Clicking a category in the sidebar instantly updates both the chart and the table with the relevant data. -> Justification: This combination provides both an immediate visual impression of the scoring balance and the granular detail needed by teachers and parents. -> Library/Method: Chart.js was chosen for its responsive, canvas-based rendering and straightforward API for dynamic data updates. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
